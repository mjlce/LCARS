Subject: The Magic of Toilet Paper<br>
<br>
A husband, tired of his wife asking him how she looks, buys her a<br>
full-length mirror. This does little to help, as now she just stands<br>
in front of the mirror, looking at herself, asking him how she looks.<br>
<br>
One day, fresh out of the shower, she is yet again in front of the<br>
mirror, now complaining that her breasts are too small.<br>
<br>
Uncharacteristically, the husband comes up with a suggestion. "If<br>
you want your breasts to grow, then every day take a piece of toilet<br>
paper, and rub it between your breasts for a few seconds.<br>
<br>
Willing to try anything, the wife fetches a piece of toilet paper,<br>
and stands in front of the mirror, rubbing it between her breasts. <br>
<br>
"How long will this take?" she asks.<br>
<br>
"They'll grow larger over a period of years," he replies.<br>
<br>
The wife stops. "Why do you think rubbing a piece of toilet paper<br>
between my breasts every day will make them grow over the years?"<br>
<br>
The husband shrugs. "Why not, it worked for your butt, didn't it?"<br>
<br>
He lived, and, with therapy, might even walk again.<br>
<br>
